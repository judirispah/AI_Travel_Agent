## 🧩Component Roles for AI Module

- **app.py**: Standalone Streamlit app for AI features.
- **app2.py**: FastAPI backend for React and LLM configuration.
- **frontend/**: Contains React code for the user interface.
- **tools/**: modular Python scripts for travel-related tasks from ' utils/ '.
- **utils/**: Provides helper modules for API calls and data processing.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists required Python packages.

## 🏗️ Error Handling & Logging

- Use custom exceptions for predictable error management.

- Log errors using the custom logger module in runtime created log files.

---

## 🔒 Security

- Store secrets and API keys in `.env` (never hardcode).
- Add `.env` and sensitive files to `.gitignore`.

---

## 🐍 Conda Environment Setup & Best Practices

- Using a Conda environment ensures consistent dependencies across machines and team members.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Coding Standards

- All Python code follows the **PEP8** formatting guidelines for consistency and readability.

---

## 📦 Dependencies
- **Python:** 
- `python-dotenv` – Manage environment variables securely.
- `langgraph` – Build graph-based LLM workflows.
- `streamlit` – Build interactive data apps and dashboards.
- `ipykernel` – Kernel interface for Jupyter and IDE support.
- `langchain-tavily` – Tavily search tool for LangChain.
- `langchain-google-community` – Google Places integration for LangChain.
- `langchain-groq` – Groq LLM integration with LangChain.
- `googlemaps` – Official Python client for Google Maps API. 

- **React/Frontend:**  
  - `package.json`: Lists all npm dependencies for the React frontend.
  - `package-lock.json`: Automatically generated by npm to lock exact dependency versions for reproducible builds.

---

## 💡Local Packages

- Uses `setup.py` to manage  Python project as a package.
- pip install -r requirments.txt installs this package installs the local package in editable mode by including the line -e . in requirements.txt.

```

## 🧱 Modularity & Reusability of API tools

- Break code into small, focused functions and classes automating the API response and info extraction.
- Avoid hardcoding values  use config files or .env file.

```

## 🧪 Testing

- All core modules have corresponding test files in the `testing/` folder.
- Uses  `unittest` for writing and running tests.
